Instead of errors coming up when you compile your code you will get runtime errors if you try performing operations on incompatible types. However, you will get the benefit of having more versatile functions as they can be written once for multiple data types. Benefits over Static: More succinct/less verbose and you spend less time debugging syntax and semantic errors.\n",

    "Static typing catches errors early, instead of finding them during execution (especially useful for long programs). It’s more “strict” in that it won’t allow for type errors anywhere in your program and often prevents variables from changing types, which further defends against unintended errors. Dynamic typing is more flexible (which some appreciate) but allows for variables to change types (sometimes creating unexpected errors).  Draw back of static: Like any formalism, types require some investment up front to become fluent in. Some tasks, especially around generic programming, can be very easily expressed in a dynamic language, but require more machinery in a static language. \n",

Standard CPython's garbage collector has two components, the reference counting collector and the generational garbage collector, known as gc module. The reference counting algorithm is incredibly efficient and straightforward, but it cannot detect reference cycles. That is why Python has a supplemental algorithm called generational cyclic GC, that deals with reference cycles. The reference counting is fundamental to Python and can't be disabled, whereas the cyclic GC is optional and can be used manually."
